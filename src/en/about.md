## Biography

I am Theethawat Savastham or you can called me Tin, a research student at the Graduate School of Engineering, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki prefecture, Japan. 

My work and academic journey has begun when I was an undergraduate student in computer engineering at the Prince of Songkla University. In 2020, I had been invited by my advisor to work with the Intelligent Automation Research Center as a Full-Stack software developer. During my work from 2020-2023, I developed various software to support the research center’s academic service.

In 2020, I was assigned as an e-commerce system development for SME businesses. Then I was assigned as one of E-Machine – the IoT monitoring and control system development starting with the water supply system in Chana, Songkhla and then scaling to another business sector such as factory or hotel.

In 2022, I started a master's degree journey to research to develop better software. I was interested in data science, machine learning, and system performance.  In October 2023, I devoted my self into a study by resigning my job, that was the time that my research journey truly begin.

During the master's degree study, I got a chance to join the Sakura Science Exchange Program in Miyazaki prefecture, Japan. On that event, I had the opportunity to met the professor from the University of Miyazaki and communicating about research experience and further study. In 2025, I got the scholarship and started my student life in Japan as a research student for my Ph.D. journey on the upcoming April.
