## Project Info

- **Project Type** : Master Degree Research Thesis
- **Year** : 2023 - Present
- **Advisor**: Assist. Prof. Dr. Nikom Suvonvorn
- **Working With**: Intelligent Automation Research Center and Department of Computer Engineering, Prince of Songkla University

## Information

Create a neural-network-inspired model specifically designed for cost estimation from the principle of artificial neural networks and a recognized cost estimation model. We select the Time-Driven Activity-based Costing, as a cost estimation framework for our model because it covers the cost both directly and indirectly way, and structures can apply to the structure of artificial neural networks.
We propose to create a simple, specific, explainable, and accurate results.
