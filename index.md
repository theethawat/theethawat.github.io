# About Myself

Hello, My name is Theethawat. Since I was in secondary school, I found that I fascinated in computer and I had the oppotunity to study in [Faculty of Engineering](https://www.eng.psu.ac.th) on [Computer Engineering Department](https://coe.psu.ac.th) since 2016. During 4.5 years of my study, computer was the place, I have created many of my idea and imagination beyond the word of impossible, until today the previous sentence still real.

On the database I am familar with NoSQL like [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/home) more than relational database. Further more I must acting as the development operation, I always use [Docker](https://docker.com) as my main technique for our application deployment.
