# About Myself

Hello, My name is Theethawat. Since I was in secondary school, I found that I fascinated in computer and I had the oppotunity to study in [Faculty of Engineering](https://www.eng.psu.ac.th) on [Computer Engineering Department](https://coe.psu.ac.th) since 2016. During 4.5 years of my study, computer was the place, I have created many of my idea and imagination beyond the word of impossible, until today the previous sentence still real.

After I graduated, I have joined [Intelligent Automation Research Center ](https://iarc.psu.ac.th) or IARC that located in my faculty to work in title of **Full Stack Developer** unitl today. I usally create frontend web application with [React](https://reactjs.org) library on top of [Javascript](https://openjsf.org/) Language and for backend I use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) with [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) as the main framework. On the database I am familar with NoSQL like [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/home) more than relational database. Further more I must acting as the development operation, I always use [Docker](https://docker.com) as my main technique for our application deployment.

The IARC duty is to research for intelligent system, automation system from the real requirement of the real business and deliver the academic session, management software or training to the business. Not only the development, about 3 years at IARC, I had travelled into visit the variety of business enterprise over the southern region of Thailand. I have learned a lot of diversity on Thailand business sector, the real requirement and a lot of experience over past 3 years.
