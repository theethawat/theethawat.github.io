# About Myself

Hello, My name is Theethawat. Since I was in secondary school, I found that I fascinated in computer and I had the oppotunity to study in [Faculty of Engineering](https://www.eng.psu.ac.th) on [Computer Engineering Department](https://coe.psu.ac.th) since 2016. During 4.5 years of my study, computer was the place, I have created many of my idea and imagination beyond the word of impossible, until today the previous sentence still real.

After I graduated, I have joined [Intelligent Automation Research Center](https://iarc.psu.ac.th) that located in my faculty to work in title of **Full Stack Developer** unitl today. I usally create frontend web application with [React](https://reactjs.org) library on top of [Javascript](https://openjsf.org/) Language and for backend I use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) with [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) as the main framework. On the database I am familar with NoSQL like [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/home) more than relational database. Further more I must acting as the development operation, I always use [Docker](https://docker.com) as my main technique for our application deployment.
